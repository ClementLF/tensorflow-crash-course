# Understanding Tensorflow

This series was written from my personal perspective, so the readers should already have some basic idea about what deep learning is, and preferably are familiar with PyTorch.

Posts are published on Medium. Notebooks are published on Google Colab.

A copy of each Colab notebook is kept in the [notebooks](/notebooks) folder.
